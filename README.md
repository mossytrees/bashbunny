# bashbunny
Just some bash bunny (https://hakshop.com/products/bash-bunny) resources.

For now, just an XMIND mind map that I created to help with troubleshooting various payloads found online, as many are not well commented, and several command names or file locations have changed over time with newer firmware versions.  Also including a PNG for consumption by non XMIND users.
